# WebAppChallenge

pre-requisites:

- DB Browser for SQLite does __NOT__ need to be installed in the machine.

From the root of the project directory run the following command
```console
python DB_transfer.py
```
An input console will open where you should put the path of the input csv data. In this case
```console
input/task_data.csv
```

This will parse the csv file into a local database called TestDB.db inside the project folder
